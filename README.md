# Memory Game Project

## Introduction: 
This is Udacity's Introduction to Programming: Front-End Development's Final Project: Memory Game!  It was written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

## Setup: 
To start the game, you can play it online [here](https://lizardscruff.github.io/memoryGame/). If you want to play on your machine, you can clone or download the zip. Unzip the folder to somewhere easy to access on your computer and double-click the index.html file within or open it in your favorite browser.

## How to Play: 
This memory game is won by matching the respective symbols to each other. The amount of moves and time you have is infinite but if you win with as little moves as possible, you can improve your star rating!
